 CMPT361 graphic assignment

What is this?

This is my graphic assignment of a graphic course. A Tetris game that was established by using WebGL. 

This project is completed in March 2021.

How does the project work?

The only thing you need is to download the project and open the .html file by any browser that supports WebGL. 

Press S to start, press UpArrow to change the shape of piece. Press q to quit, Press r to restart.

Known issues:

1. The game is laggy when there are too many objects on the screen/ you press the keyboard too fast. If you press the keyboard too fast, some functions may not work properly.

2. Still Working on the grading system, I might finish it sometime or maybe I will just leave it.
